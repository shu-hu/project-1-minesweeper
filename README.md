## Minesweeper
Minesweeper is a classic Microsoft game, which released in 1990. The goal of Minesweeper is to uncover all the squares on a board that do not contain mines. The reason I chose this game as the unit one project is because that was the first computer game I played, and I'm quite familiar with the rules.
